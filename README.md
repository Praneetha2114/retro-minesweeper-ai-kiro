# Retro Minesweeper AI (Kiro Week 4)

This project recreates the classic Minesweeper game with a modern AI twist.
The AI explains why certain moves are safe or risky, helping players understand
the logic behind the game.

Built for the Kiro Week 4 Retro Revival Challenge.

Kiro was used conceptually to design and validate complex game logic, break down AI reasoning into steps, and iterate quickly on explainability. The project structure follows Kiro’s workflow-driven approach.
