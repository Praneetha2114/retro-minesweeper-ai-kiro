# Retro Minesweeper AI (Kiro Week 4)

This project recreates the classic Minesweeper game with a modern AI twist.
The AI explains why certain moves are safe or risky, helping players understand
the logic behind the game.

Built for the Kiro Week 4 Retro Revival Challenge.


## How Kiro Helped

Kiro accelerated development by providing a structured, workflow-driven approach
to designing complex logic. The AI explanation system was broken down into clear
steps such as board state analysis, constraint interpretation, and user-facing
reasoning.

This approach reduced debugging effort, improved clarity in the AI logic, and
made it easier to iterate on explainable gameplay behavior.
